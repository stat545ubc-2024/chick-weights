# Shiny App that visualizes chick weights by diet
## Emily Zhang
### STAT545B, 2024 WT1

This app allows you to view the ChickWeight dataset that is built into R and visualize the data as a histogram. The data comes from an experiment on the effect of diet on early growth of chicks. Users can see a scrollable, sortable table showing the dataset and can optionally generate a histogram based on the data in the table. 

Three features are built into the shiny app that improves its functionality:
- Feature 1: Filter dataset based on diet; allows users to select what data they wish to view based on their research goals
- Feature 2: Display number of results after filtering; the user can see how many chicks are in each diet group
- Feature 3: Users can generate a histogram of chick weight based on the filtered dataset to better visualize the distribution of the data
